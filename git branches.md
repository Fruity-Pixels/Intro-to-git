# Git Branches

* __Listing all git branches:__ git branch

* __Adding a branch:__ git checkout -b _newBranchName_ (this is actually add a new branch and checkout. _git-branch_ is the basic new branch command)

* __Changing branches:__ git checkout _branchName_

* __Merging a branch:__ From the repo where we want to merge TO: git merge _branchName_

* __Removing a branch:__ Removing a branch is generally not a good idea. If we still want to: git branch -d _branchName_
